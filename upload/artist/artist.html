        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter
          known for his bold colors, swirling brushstrokes, and emotional
          intensity. A troubled genius, he struggled with mental illness
          throughout his life, yet produced some of the most iconic paintings in
          Western art history. His works, including "Starry Night,"
          "Sunflowers," and "The Bedroom," continue to inspire and captivate
          audiences around the world.

        <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
        <p>
          "I dream my painting and I paint my dream." - Vincent van Gogh (In a
          letter to his brother Theo, 1888)
        </p>
        <p>
          Van Gogh's art was often an expression of his inner turmoil and his
          yearning for beauty and connection. He believed in the power of color
          and brushwork to evoke emotions and convey his unique perspective on
          the world.
