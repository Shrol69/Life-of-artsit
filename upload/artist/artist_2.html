        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) was a Mexican Surrealist painter known for her
          self-portraits and bold exploration of identity, gender, the human
          body, and pain. Despite a debilitating bus accident at a young age,
          she channeled her experiences into powerful and deeply personal
          artwork that continues to resonate with viewers today.

        <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
        <p>
          "I paint my reality. The more I suffer, the more I paint; the more
          reality I paint, the stronger I become." - Frida Kahlo
        </p>
        <p>
          Kahlo's art often blurred the lines between dreams and reality, using
          symbolism and allegory to explore themes of self-discovery, physical
          and emotional trauma, and Mexican culture.

            <p>The Two Fridas, 1939 by Frida Kahlo</p>
            <p>
              This painting was completed shortly after her divorce with Diego
              Rivera. This portrait shows Frida's two different personalities.
              One is the traditional Frida in Tehuana costume, with a broken
              heart, sitting next to an independent, modern dressed Frida. In
              Frida's diary, she wrote about this painting and said it is
              originated from her memory of an imaginary childhood friend. Later
              she admitted it expressed her desperation and loneliness with the
              separation from Diego.

            <p>The Wounded Deer, 1946 by Frida Kahlo</p>
            <p>
              In this painting, Frida used a young deer with the head of herself
              and was fatally wounded by a bunch of arrows. The background is
              the forest with dead trees and broken branches, which implied the
              feeling of fear and desperation. Far away is the stormy,
              lightning-lit sky which brings some hope but the dear will never
              be able to reach it. In 1946 Frida Kahlo had an operation on her
              spine in New York. She was hoping this surgery would free her from
              the severe back pain but it failed. This painting expressed her
              disappointment towards the operation. After she went back to
              Mexico, she suffered both physical pain and emotional depression.
              In this painting she depicted herself as a young stag with her own
              head crowned with antlers. This young stag is pierced by arrows
              and bleeding. At the lower-left corner, the artist wrote down the
              word "Carma", which means "destiny" or "fate". Just like her other
              self-portraits, in this painting Frida expressed the sadness that
              she cannot change her own fate.

            <p>Henry Ford Hospital, 1932 by Frida Kahlo</p>
            <p>
              In this painting, Frida depicts herself in Henry Ford Hospital,
              lying on the bed naked with blood and hemorrhage. As in Four
              Inhabitants of Mexico, this painting has a very intimate space.
              The body is twisted and the bed is tipped up and that adds the
              feelings of helplessness and disconnection. The discomfort showed
              with the way she painted her body: from the waist up she turns
              toward the viewer; from the waist down she turns away. This
              painting is a reflection of what Frida felt when she was having a
              miscarriage at Henry Ford Hospital. There are six objects flying
              around her. A male fetus which is the son of her and Diego she has
              longed to have. The fetus is based on a medical illustration. An
              orchid looks like a uterus. The stomach she holds against the red
              ribbons and they look like umbilical cords. The snail is the
              symbol of the slowness of the operation.
