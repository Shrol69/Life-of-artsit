        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Claude Monet (1840-1926) was a French painter and founder of
          Impressionist painting. Considered a key precursor to modernism, he
          strived to capture the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere in his
          landscapes. His work, characterized by loose brushstrokes and vibrant
          colors, revolutionized the art world and continues to inspire artists
          and viewers alike.

        <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
        <p>
          "I want to paint what cannot be described, what stays unseen because
          it is only felt." - Claude Monet
        </p>
        <p>
          Monet believed in capturing the essence of a scene through light and
          color, rather than focusing on precise details. He often painted the
          same subject multiple times at different times of day, showcasing the
          ever-changing light and mood.

            <p>Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son, 1875</p>
            <p>
              With Manet's assistance, Monet found lodging in suburban
              Argenteuil in late 1871, a move that initiated one of the most
              fertile phases of his career. Impressionism evolved in the late
              1860s from a desire to create full–scale, multi–figure depictions
              of ordinary people in casual outdoor situations. At its purest,
              impressionism was attuned to landscape painting, a subject Monet
              favored. In Woman with a Parasol – Madame Monet and Her Son, his
              skill as a figure painter is equally evident. Contrary to the
              artificial conventions of academic portraiture, Monet delineated
              the features of his sitters as freely as their surroundings. The
              spontaneity and naturalness of the resulting image were praised
              when it appeared in the second impressionist exhibition in 1876.

            <p>The Artist's Garden at Giverny, 1900 by Claude Monet</p>
            <p>
              Throughout his life, Monet had been an avid and knowledgeable
              gardener. It was at Giverny, however, his last home and the place
              he lived at for the longest, that his vision for a garden became a
              reality. He was meticulous in his approach to planning the garden,
              which expanded over the gears to incorporate his now-famous pond.
              Monet undertook extensive research for his garden and planned and
              planted his flowerbeds with the color of his blooms and the time
              of their flowering foremost in his mind to produce a coherent
              aesthetic throughout. His garden was a constant source of
              inspiration to him, particularly in later life, and included one
              especially important flowerbed planted in memory of his beloved
              aunt. The flowerbed was below the artist's bedroom window and was
              an exact copy of one that his aunt had had, and he had painted, at
              her home in Sainte-Adresse.

            <p>The Garden at Sainte-Adresse, 1967 by Claude Monet</p>
            <p>
              The Garden at Sainte-Adresse, 1967 by Claude Monet The Garden at
              Sainte-Adresse, 1967 by Claude Monet Monet spent the summer of
              1867 at the resort town of Sainte-Adresse on the English Channel,
              near Le Havre (France). It was there, in a garden with a view of
              Honfleur on the horizon, that he painted this picture, which
              combines smooth, traditionally rendered areas with sparkling
              passages of rapid, separate brushwork, and spots of pure color.
              Scenes of the fashionable bourgeoisie at leisure were a favoured
              subject matter for many of the young artists of the day. Although
              Monet later abandoned these subjects, he painted them with
              enthusiasm, nearly always choosing scenes involving either water,
              flowers or landscape. Glimpses of Monet's future artistic
              development can be seen in his treatment of the flowers, wrought
              in vibrant colors with short, blocky brushstrokes. In contrast,
              the figures and the garden furniture are tightly painted and
              sharply delineated with much use of white highlights. Monet called
              this work in his correspondence "the Chinese painting in which
              there are flags"; his friend, Renoir referred to it as "the
              Japanese painting". In the 1860s, the composition's flat
              horizontal bands of color would have reminded the sophisticated of
              Japanese color wood-block prints, which were avidly collected by
              Monet, Manet, Renoir, Whistler and others in their circle. The
              print by the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai that may have
              inspired this picture, "Turban-shell Hall of the
              Five-Hundred-Rakan Temple" (1830), remains today at Monet's
              house-museum at Giverny.
